# Sublime-MCFunction
A Sublime Text 3 plugin to add syntax highlighting and other functionality for the function file format (`.mcfunction`) added to Minecraft in the 1.12 prereleases.

![Demonstration of highlighting](pics/demo1.png)  
*Shown using Monokai*

Highlights comments, commands, entity selectors, numbers, namespaces, NBT, `this.sort.of.thing`, blockstates, and more (depending on color theme support).

Points out errors in NBT syntax, as well as invalid forward slashes at the beginnings of lines.

You can add special highlighting to comments by beginning them with `#~`.
