# Sublime-MCFunction
A Sublime Text 3 package that adds syntax highlighting and other functionality for Minecraft's function file format (`.mcfunction`) added in the 1.12 prereleases.

*Shown using Monokai*

Highlights comments, commands, entity selectors, numbers, namespaces, NBT, `this.sort.of.thing`, blockstates, and more (depending on color theme support).

Points out errors in NBT syntax, as well as invalid forward slashes at the beginnings of lines.

You can add special highlighting to comments by beginning them with `#~`.

# Package Control Installation
